# hello-world
My first GitHub repository
Hello! I am a new learner of python. I'am trying to create a program that I can use in my work as a teacher. My pupils are on practice-work 2-4 days a week, and I'am supposed to visit them on a regular basis, every tenth day. I have been taking some courses in python and know the basics, but I have to improve my scills on some projects.
